malloc is a function in C programming that dynamically allocates memory, while free is used to release that allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

The goal of this project is to understand:

What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
What is malloc and free and how to use them
Why and when use malloc
How to use valgrind to check for memory leak
